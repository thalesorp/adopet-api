# AdoPet

Project developed for the 6th back-end challenge given by [Alura](https://www.alura.com.br/challenges/back-end-6).

**AdoPet** is a web application that connects would-be pet guardians with NGOs working to find a new home for animals for adoption.

This repository contains the source code of the REST API developed in Java with the Spring Boot 3 framework, which provides services to the AdoPet application. For the front end part of the project, please refer to the [AdoPet front end repository](https://github.com/sucodelarangela/adopet) by [Angela Caldas](https://github.com/sucodelarangela).


## üí° Features

The AdoPet API provides the following endpoints for interacting with the platform:

- Guardians CRUD:

    - `POST /guardians`: Creates a new guardian. Request body example:

        ```JSON
        {
            "name": "Fulano",
            "email": "fulano@email.com",
            "password": "abcd1234",
            "passwordConfirmation": "abcd1234"
        }
        ```

        - `201 Created`: The guardian was created sucessfully. The response body will contain a JSON with the newly created guardian data, and the response header will contain a location indicating the URL of the newly created resource. Response body example:

            ```JSON
            {
                "id": 1,
