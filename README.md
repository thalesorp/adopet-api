# AdoPet

Project developed for the 6th back-end challenge given by [Alura](https://www.alura.com.br/challenges/back-end-6). *#AluraChallenges*

**AdoPet** is a web application that connects would-be pet guardians with NGOs working to find a new home for animals for adoption.

This repository contains the source code of the REST API developed in Java with the Spring Boot 3 framework, which provides services to the AdoPet application. For the front-end part of the project, please refer to the [AdoPet front-end repository](https://github.com/sucodelarangela/adopet) by [Angela Caldas](https://github.com/sucodelarangela).


## üí° Features

The AdoPet API provides the following endpoints for interacting with the platform:

- `GET /animals`: returns a list of animals available for adoption.
- TBD


## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use

To run the project locally, you will need to have JDK 20 installed on your machine. Then, simply clone the repository and run the `./mvnw spring-boot:run` command in the project root. The REST API will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.
